# Teamleague#1 page
A javascript examination in Async and Ajax

### About
This project is a page for my team 'TeamLeague#1', a mix of humble yet powerful men and women who plays Heroes of the Storm.
On the page you can generate our team's ranking and search for an opponent you can compare it with. The search gets stats and data from HotsLogs.com, a site dedicated to statistics and ranking in Heros of the Storm.
